title: 'Custom events'

Beampipe allows you to log custom events from your webpage. These can be used to track drop-off rates or notify you should something interesting happen.

Our tracker script (see [Getting started](/getting-started)) will automatically register a function on the `window` object called `window.beampipe`.

To log an event, simply invoke this function wherever you like:

```js
window.beampipe('signup');
```
