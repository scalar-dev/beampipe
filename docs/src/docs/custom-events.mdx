title: 'Custom events and goals'
---

Beampipe allows you to log custom events from your webpage. These can be used to track drop-off rates or notify you should something interesting happen.

## Logging  events
Our tracker script (see [Getting started](/getting-started)) will automatically register a function on the `window` object called `window.beampipe`.

To log an event, simply invoke this function wherever you like:

```js
window.beampipe('signup');
```


## Configuring goals
Once events are being captured by beampipe, you can set up a **Goal** to
track the events. To do this, go to the domain view for the domain against
which you are logging events. At the bottom of this page you will find the
**Goals** card. It should look like this:

![Goals card](/goals_card.png)

Click the button marked **Create a goal** and you will see a modal dialog.
Fill in the **Name** and **Description** fields with whatever makes sense for
your site. The **Event type** must match the string passed to the beampipe
function above. To track the `signup` events as a goal, we could fill it in as follows:

![Modal](/create_goal_filled.png)

You can also configure page views as goals. In this case, the event type will be **page_view** and you must specify a path within website e.g. `/`.
