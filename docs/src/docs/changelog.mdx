- Minor: Added usage quotas to the Settings page (these are still soft quotas for now).

- Minor: Improved the upgrade experience.

- Major: Added drilldowns! You can now click on the **Pages** table, the **Sources** table and the  **Countries** map to explore subsets of your data. Currently this is applied to the time chart but soon it'll show up in other charts as well. 

  You can select several drilldowns together and they will be applied conjunctively (i.e. all selections must match).
