Beampipe features built-in Slack integration with our Pro subscription. Any events fired in your application (see [Custom events](/custom-events) can be used to trigger Slack notifications.


1. Configure our Slack bot

- Go to Beampipe's **Settings** page. Here you should see an **Add to Slack** button. You'll need to give us some privileges to access your Slack workspace. Once this is done, you should see the **Beampipe** bot appear in your Slack workspace.



# 2. Subscribe to events

- To subscribe to particular events within a Slack channel. First head over to the Slack channel where you want the notifications to appear. You can then use the Beampipe slash command as follows:

```text
/beampipe subscribe example.com signup
```x

Here `signup` can be any event type logged from your application. Once configured, you'll receive notifications for any matching events in your Slack channel.
