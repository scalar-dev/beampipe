Beampipe features built-in Slack integration with our Pro subscription. You can subscribe to notifications for custom events logged by your site (see [Custom events](/custom-events)) or receive weekly traffic summary reports.


## 1. Configure our Slack bot

Go to Beampipe's **Settings** page. Here you should see an **Add to Slack** button. You'll need to give us some privileges to access your Slack workspace. Once this is done, you should see the **Beampipe** bot appear in your Slack workspace.



## 2. Subscribe to notifications

You can see a list of commands at any time by doing:

```text
/beampipe help
```

To receive notifications when a particular event is triggered, first head over to the Slack channel where you want the notifications to appear. You can then use the Beampipe slash command as follows:

```text
/beampipe subscribe example.com signup
```

Here `example.com` is your domain id and `signup` can be any event type logged by your site. You'll receive notifications for any matching events in your Slack channel. This can be great for sharing success when you get a signup or a subscription upgrade.

To get a weekly traffic summary report, 

```text
/beampipe summary
```

This will be sent at 5pm every Friday in whatever timezone you've configured in your user settings (by default UTC).

To unsubscribe from any of these notifications,

```text
/beampipe list
```

You'll see a list of your active subscriptions within the current channel and can click to ubsubscribe.
